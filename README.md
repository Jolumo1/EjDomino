# Domino Game - Console Application

## Description

**Domino Game** is a console-based game developed in Java where players work with domino tiles to play a game. The game provides options to fill an array with random tiles, play a match, and try different variations of the game. 
This project was designed to practice and review concepts of object-oriented programming and array manipulation in Java.
Please notices than all the variable names and comments are in spanish.

## Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to practice and reinforce key programming concepts, such as:

- Use of classes and objects.
- Array manipulation and dynamic handling of collections.
- Methods and control flow (loops, conditionals).
- User interaction via the console.
- Implementing basic game logic.

## Gameplay

The game is played in the **console**. There are several options available in the menu for interacting with the game:

1. **Fill the Array with Random Tiles:** Generates an array of 28 random domino tiles and prints them.
2. **Play a Match:** Plays a simple match where tiles are matched by their values and printed in order.
3. **Play Match with Alternative Method:** Uses a different method for matching tiles, demonstrating another approach to the game logic.

### Main Features:

- **Random Tile Generation:** You can fill an array with random domino tiles.
- **Tile Matching:** The program checks if the values on the right side of one tile match the left side of the next.
- **Tile Flipping:** If the values don't match, the tiles can be flipped to try matching in the opposite orientation.
- **Manual Tile Insertion:** Players can manually input tiles into the array if there is space available.

## Additional Features

- **Multiple Match Variations:** The program offers two different methods for playing a match, with different logic for matching tiles.
- **Dynamic Tile Handling:** The game handles tile flipping and array manipulation based on the state of the game.
